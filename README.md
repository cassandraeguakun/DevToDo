# DevToDo
DevToDo is a simple project planner for prgrammers with a twist. 

I built this web-app with Django for developers who want a simple way of documenting ideas. 
You can create projects and features you plan to implement and add components/modules. You can also break these down into simple tasks with deadlines.

Feel free to fork this project and make it your own.

View the live app on https://devtodo.caja.ng

Features currently include are:

Create and list projects
Create and list modules (e.g authentication, notification etc)
Create tasks to complete each module
Login and Signup


More features will be added as the need arises!
